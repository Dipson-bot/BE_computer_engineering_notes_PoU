## 🗒️ Personal Notes Included

I’ve also added my **own handwritten and typed notes** to the Drive folder. These cover:
- Key concepts in core subjects
- Exam preparation tips
- Solved past papers
- Summary sheets for quick revision

These personal notes are free to use — just remember to give credit if you share them elsewhere.
